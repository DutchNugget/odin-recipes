    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Authentic Carbonara is a rich and creamy Italian pasta dish made with just a few simple ingredients, and contrary to popular depiction 
       there’s no cream involved—just the natural richness of the eggs and cheese creates a velvety sauce that clings perfectly to the pasta.
       A true Roman classic, Carbonara is all about balance—savory, smoky, and with the perfect amount of peppery bite. It’s comfort food at its finest!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200g pasta (spaghetti or bucatini)</li>
            <li>100g guanciale (or pancetta if guanciale isn't available)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>50g Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Salt (for pasta water)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil the pasta</strong> 
                <br> 
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. 
                Make sure to save about a cup of pasta water before draining. </li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>Prepare the guanciale</strong>
                <br>
                While the pasta cooks, cut the guanciale into small strips or cubes. 
                Heat a pan over medium heat and add the guanciale. Cook until it's crispy and golden, about 5-7 minutes.
                Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>Prepare the egg mixture</strong>
                <br>
                In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and the grated Pecorino Romano cheese until smooth and combined. 
                Add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. This will form your creamy sauce base.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>Combine pasta and guanciale</strong>
                <br>
                Once the pasta is cooked and drained (saving some of the pasta water), add the pasta to the pan with the guanciale.
                If the pan is too dry, you can add a little bit of the reserved pasta water to help coat the pasta.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>Mix with egg mixture</strong>
                <br>Remove the pan from the heat to avoid scrambling the eggs. 
                Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing vigorously to create a creamy sauce. 
                Add a little reserved pasta water if needed to help emulsify the sauce to your desired creaminess.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>Season and serve</strong>
                <br>
                Plate the pasta, and if desired, sprinkle a bit more Pecorino and black pepper on top for extra flavor. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This method ensures a creamy, rich sauce without the need for heavy cream, relying on the egg and cheese combination for that perfect texture.</p>
