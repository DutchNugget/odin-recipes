    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Gazpacho is a refreshing and vibrant Spanish cold soup that’s perfect for hot summer days.
        Packed with fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and onions, it’s a burst of flavor in every spoonful.
        The soup is typically blended to a smooth consistency, though some like to keep it a bit chunky for added texture.
        A drizzle of olive oil, a splash of vinegar, and a pinch of salt tie everything together, making it a zesty, cooling dish. 
        It’s light, healthy, and full of antioxidants—perfect as a starter, snack, or even a light meal. Serve it chilled with a sprinkle of fresh herbs, and maybe a side of crusty bread for the ultimate summer treat!</p>
